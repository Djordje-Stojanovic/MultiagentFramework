## Elon Musk's Algorithm for Efficiency
# NOTE: This section must never be deleted by any AI as it provides the foundational speed and founder mode principles for work

1. Question every requirement
   - Is this feature truly necessary?
   - Does it solve a real user problem?
   - Can we achieve the same result with existing features?
   - ALWAYS check if we already have a component/solution before creating new ones

2. Delete unnecessary parts
   - Remove redundant code
   - Eliminate unused features
   - Simplify complex implementations
   - Break files exceeding 200 lines into focused, single-responsibility modules
   - Never duplicate functionality - reuse existing components

3. Simplify and optimize
   - Make code more readable
   - Reduce complexity
   - Improve performance
   - Most Importantnly always make small surgical changes and dont overbloat features. Never introduce code that breaks the app.

4. Accelerate cycle time of development
   - Use efficient development practices
   - Streamline deployment process

5. Automate
   - Automate repetitive tasks
   - Create reusable components

## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality
- Proper error handling
- Clean up resources
- Validate inputs

### Performance
- Lazy load components
- Optimize queries using proper indexes
- Implement caching strategies
- Compress assets

## Tech Stack & Structure

### Agent Framework: Pydantic AI
- Minimal abstraction with maximum control
- Built by the Pydantic team (production-ready)
- Excellent documentation and developer experience
- Native support for structured outputs

### LLM Support (All Models from OpenAI, Google, Anthropic)

**OpenAI Models (August 2025):**
- GPT-5 (75.84 benchmark) - Top performer
- o3 Pro High / o3 High / o3 Medium - Advanced reasoning
- o4-Mini High/Medium - Fast & cost-effective
- GPT-4.5 Preview, GPT-4.1 - Production models

**Anthropic Models (August 2025):**
- Claude 4.1 Opus Thinking (73.48) - Best reasoning
- Claude 4 Opus/Sonnet Thinking - Deep analysis
- Claude 4 Opus/Sonnet - Production workhorses
- Claude 3.7 Sonnet - Fast responses

**Google Models (August 2025):**
- Gemini 2.5 Pro Max Thinking (70.95) - Advanced reasoning
- Gemini 2.5 Pro - General purpose
- Gemini 2.5 Flash - Fast inference
- Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite - Cost-optimized

### Supporting Infrastructure
- **Message Protocol**: Simple JSON (KISS principle)
- **Orchestration**: Sequential initially, then expand
- **State Management**: In-memory dict → Redis later
- **Tools**: MCP (Model Context Protocol) for standardization

## Project Vision - The Endgame
**Goal:** Build an automated army of AI agents that collaborate, discuss, critique, and produce optimal solutions matching the quality of professional teams (JPM-level software dev teams, Warren Buffett-level investing, Trump-level negotiation, CIA-level intelligence analysis). We aim to maximize accuracy, minimize hallucination, optimize innovation, and enhance AI's writing capabilities in both software and text.

## Development Approach
**Focus on the next step only.** We work incrementally - identify what the user wants next, execute it, then stop. No feature bloat, no over-engineering.

## Project Overview
MultiAgent Framework is a comprehensive platform for building and managing multi-agent systems. This document serves as a reference for Cline about the project capabilities and available tools.

## Available MCP Servers

### 1. GitHub MCP Server (Remote GitHub Operations)
**Server Name:** `github.com/github/github-mcp-server`
**Purpose:** Complete GitHub API integration for remote repository management
**Authentication:** Personal Access Token with full repository permissions

**Available Tool Categories:**
- **Repository Management**: Browse code, search files, analyze commits, manage branches
- **Issues & Pull Requests**: Create, update, manage issues and PRs, handle reviews
- **GitHub Actions**: Monitor workflows, analyze build failures, manage CI/CD
- **Code Security**: Review security alerts, Dependabot findings, secret scanning
- **Notifications**: Manage GitHub notifications and subscriptions
- **Gists**: Create and manage code snippets
- **Organizations**: Search and manage GitHub organizations
- **Users**: Search GitHub users and profiles

**Key Tools Include:**
- `get_me` - Get authenticated user profile
- `search_repositories` - Search GitHub repositories
- `create_repository` - Create new repositories
- `list_issues` - List repository issues
